How to add a card:
1. Append basic info to the dictionary at the end of 'singletons/CardList.gd'
```
"unique id number":{
  "name":"...",
  "suit":"...",
  "value":...,
  "attributes":[REWARD],
  "description":"..."
}
```
suit can be hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, special, all_suits_at_once
multiple attributes can be used at once, pick from these options:
 * REWARD (card can be offered as reward between rounds)
 * STANDARD (card is from one of the 4 starter decks)
 * NEGATIVE_STANDARD (card is negative version of a STANDARD card)
 * UNOBTAINABLE (card is only used in other cards' effects, never a permanent part of a deck)
 * TAROT (card can be offered in tarot reading encounter)
 * JACK
 * QUEEN
 * KING
 * ACE

2. Create 'card_effect_resources/card_effect_[id].tres' with the exact contents:
```
[gd_resource type="Resource" load_steps=2 format=2]

[ext_resource path="res://card_effect_resources/CardEffect[id].gd" type="Script" id=1]

[resource]
script = ExtResource( 1 )
```
(replace [id] with the unique id number)

3. Create 'card_effect_resources/CardEffect[id].gd' with the header:
```
extends Resource
signal [...]
var effects_list = [...]
```

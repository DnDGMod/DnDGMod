singletons/RoomList.gd starts with enums:

var [Area]Rooms = {
    ENCOUNTER_[CHARACTER] = "[area]_encounter_[character]"
}

Line 100 has the `[area]_easy_random_encounters` and `[area]_hard_random_encounters`. They are each a list of encounters from the Enum

Line 174 has the `room_dictionary.` Entries look like this:
[Area]Rooms.ENCOUNTER_[CHARACTER]: {
    "name": "...",
    "type": "opponent",
    "sprite": [x,y],  # presumably coordinates for a spritesheet
    "healthpoints": ...,
    "deck": [...],  # list of card IDs as strings
    "chip_reward": ...,
    "start_dialogue": "...",
    "end_dialogue": "...",
}
Key is encounter from enum!
